- Smart contract has a string field which serves as the comment from the last contributor
- To change the string, you must donate more than the last string-changer
- At the end of every month (using an oracle) or more easily: after reaching a certain threshold, the tokens will be donated over [GiveCrypto](https://givecrypto.org/)
